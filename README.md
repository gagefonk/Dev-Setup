# Dev-Setup
Dev Env scripts and associated .dotfiles

*Disclaimer: Do not run scripts blindly over the internet. These are configured/tailored to suit my needs. I am not responsible for any unintended effects or consequences of you running these on your machine.

Run this command in terminal to install full dev env:
```
bash <( curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gagefonk/Dev-Setup/master/terminalSetup.sh )
```
Run this command to only install NVIM setup:
```
bash <( curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gagefonk/Dev-Setup/master/nvimSetup.sh )
```
## Acknowledgements
NVIM was mostly copied/modified from [@edr3x](https://github.com/edr3x)
