# Dev-Setup

Dev Env scripts and associated .dotfiles

\*Disclaimer: Do not run scripts blindly over the internet. These are configured/tailored to fit my needs. I am not responsible for any unintended effects or consequences of you running a program/script on your machine.
This is a WIP.

Run this command in terminal to install full dev env:

```
bash <( curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gagefonk/Dev-Setup/master/terminalSetup.sh )
```

Run this command in terminal to install nvim only:

```
bash <( curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gagefonk/Dev-Setup/master/nvimsetup.sh )
```
